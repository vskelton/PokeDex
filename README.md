# Sample Pokemon Application

### Description
I was tasked with building a small web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from a Pokemon external API.

Key features include loading data from an external API, veiwing a list of Pokemon, and when clicking on a Pokemon, you will be able to view additional details on the Pokemon.

Bootstrap was also implemented to help create a cleaner and usable design.
